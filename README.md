## Anime Trivia

This is a test repo where I am building a anime database using web scrapping and dbt.

The goal is to host this in my raspberry pi and run a job that we scrapes MAL on a weekly basis, stores the raw data in postgres.

I then use dbt to transform the data into something more useful.

I am also testing a new JS Framework (I know... but this one is different) called VanJs. Which is a framework that does not use
jsx and it's less than 1kb.

The final thing that I need to do is host this super east client side app in my raspberry pi to see if it works.
